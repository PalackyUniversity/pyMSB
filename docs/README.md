### MÃ¶ssbauer package documentation

This documentation is build with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and [pydata_sphinx_theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). 
To build the documentation, you need to have Sphinx and the theme installed. 
You can install them with pip:

```bash
pip install sphinx
pip install pydata_sphinx_theme
```

To build the documentation, navigate to the `docs` directory and run:

```bash 
make html
```

First autogenerated files will be generated in the `docs/source/api/generated` directory by the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension. Then the documentation will be built in the `docs/build/html` directory.
To view the documentation, open the `index.html` file in your browser.

Both generated files and the built documentation are ignored by git and should not be committed to the repository.
