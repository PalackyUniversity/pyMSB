pyMSB Documentation
===================

Welcome to the pyMSB documentation!

The pyMSB is a Python package for the analysis of Mossbauer spectra featuring both Classical and Bayesian approach.
Build and fit Mössbauer models to your datasets with ease and gain valuable insights into the underlying physics.

The pyMSB Python package is a part of the BayMoss project, which aims to provide a comprehensive platform for the analysis of Mossbauer spectra.
The project is built on the same methods and models as this package, but wraps them in a user-friendly interface that allows you to easily share and discuss your results with whoever you chose.
The goal of the BayMoss project is to accelerate and democratize the Mössbauer methods.

   Don't want to play alone? Join the BayMoss community online to collaborate and share with your colleagues, university team, customers, or even the whole world!
   BayMoss project powers not only the right analysis tools but also database of models and datasets, and a platform for sharing and discussing them.
